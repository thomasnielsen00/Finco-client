# Client for Finco's Investment Application

## Project Description

This client side has been developed as a part of our Bachelor thesis in Digital Business Development at NTNU. The server side of the application can be found at: [https://github.com/thomasnielsen00/Finco-server]. Our application provides a new and innovative way to make investment decisions, as requested by Finco AS. We are using Vercel to host our client, and the address to our application is: [https://finco-client.vercel.app/]. The web application offers a variety of functionality to make your investing easier:

- Users can create their own profiles and log in.
- Users can view a list of all companies with their theoretical stock value, real-time stock prices, and the difference between them.
- Users can sort and search for companies.
- Users can simulate buying and selling stocks, with potential profit presented.
- Users can track their active investments and view their portfolio.
- Users can update information regarding desired investment amount, risk tolerance, and preferred industries.
- Users have the option to switch the language of the page between Norwegian and English.

## Start Client

Install dependencies and bundle client files:

```sh
npm install
npm start
``` 


This may take a few minutes, and when it is done, the application will automatically open in your default browser. The server connection does have a connection limit, so if you get prompted with a server error, please try again in a few minutes.

Please contact one of the contributors if you have any questions. You can reach us at [thomaeni@stud.ntnu.no], [bknielse@stud.ntnu.no], or [paaldv@stud.ntnu.no].
